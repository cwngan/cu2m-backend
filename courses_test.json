                "description": "This course aims to introduce students to the major religions, traditions and cultures of India, with the exception of Islam. It offers students a lively and effective learning experience through fieldwork. There are two options for fieldwork which students can choose from. \n1: Visiting various Hindu, Sikh and Jain temples in Hong Kong\n2: A 10 day visit to India that will include visiting both religious and historical sites.\nIn both cases students will learn through first-hand exposure to religious relics, sites, material culture and personal interactions with Indian practitioners of different faiths. The sites of visit will be organized and led by experienced member(s) of the teaching staff. Sites to be visited in Hong Kong and India will include mainstream traditions within the broad framework of Hinduism, such as the Vaishnava Bhakti movement and the Shaiva tradition. Field work will also include visits to traditions that originally arose as challenges to mainstream Hinduism such as the Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs. \nThere will be six lectures conducted on campus prior to the fieldwork that will offer students an overview of the geographical, philosophical and historical background of the sites that will be visited and the traditions we will interact with. \nStudents who select option 1 will spend the rest of the term on fieldwork in Hong Kong. This will be planned together with the instructor. For students who select option 2 a ten day trip to India during the Christmas holidays will be arranged. \nFieldwork should add up to approximately 21 hours of off campus learning which will include on-site lectures, on-the-spot investigations and tutorial discussions during the trip. Both a pre-trip and a post-trip assignment in the form of a reading report, essay and/or presentation are required. . \nIt should be noted that enrolment for option 2 is limited to 25 persons with the course being conducted in English and Chinese. For more details regarding option 2 please contact the department. \nCourse content:\nI. Lectures\n(1) History and geography of India\n(2) Jainism and Zoroastrainism\n(3) Sikhism\n(4) Bahai\u2019i\n(5) The Vaishnava Bhakti movement\n(6) Planning for Fieldwork\nII. Fieldwork",
